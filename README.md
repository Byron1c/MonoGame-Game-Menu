# MonoGame-Game-Menu

This is the beginnings of a template for a game menu for MonoGame, based on a bunch of different sample code and tutorials Ive collected over the years for XNA.

Screens are added and removed dynamically, and can be customised as you need.

It includes a customisable Options screen for storing settings for Resolution, Full Screen, Volume Control, Graphics Detail, etc.
